 *  Question 6:
 *
 *  Implement in Java a similar algorithm to that in Q5, i.e. given a
 *  block of text your algorithm should be able to redact words from
 *  a given set and outputs the result to a file called â€œresult.txtâ€�.
 *  However, in this implementation of the algorithm all
 *  redactable words will be proper nouns (i.e. a name used for an
 *  individual person, place, or organisation, spelled with an initial
 *  capital letter) and your algorithm should take into account that
 *  the list of redactable words might not be complete. For example,
 *  given the block of text:
 *      It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna
 *      Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress
 *      Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili
 *      Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first
 *      to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for
 *      some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe;
 *      grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by
 *      the elite.
 *
 *  and the redactable set of words
 *      Anna Pavlovna Scherer, St. Petersburg, Marya Fedorovna
 *
 *  the output text should be
 *      It was in ****, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known ****
 *      ******** *******, maid of honor and favorite of the *******
 *      ***** *********. With these words she greeted ****** ******
 *      *******, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first
 *      to arrive at her reception. **** ******** had had a cough for
 *      some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe;
 *      grippe being then a new word in *** **********, used only by
 *      the elite.
 *
 *  You should test your program using the example files provided.
